App: To-do List

Hi Professor Rabinovich,

I created a To-Do List Application that lets users create different lists and tasks within those lists. For example, a user can create a "Grocery" list and, within this list, create "Purchase a quart of oatmilk", "Pick 10 apples from the neighbor's tree", 
"Buy chicken nuggets from Trader Joe's" tasks.

I used Spring Boot, JDK, Hibernate, Spring Framework, and Spring Data JPA for the web server. For the frontend, I used Angular 8,
Bootstrap, npm, and JQuery.

I deployed my application using AWS Beanstalk on an EC2 server. 

Requirements:
-Single Page Application (SPA): The Angular frontend takes care of the 

-Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern: 

-Object-relational mapping (ORM) technique for database management: 

-Dependency injection: 

-Use tokens for authentication: I integrated Google Sign-In in my application, which manages the token lifecycle and uses Google 
APIs with OAuth 2.0 authorization.
