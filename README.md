App: To-do List

Hi Professor Rabinovich,

I created a To-Do List Application that lets users create different lists and tasks within those lists. For example, a user can create
a "Grocery" list and, within this list, create "Purchase a quart of oatmilk", "Pick 10 apples from the neighbor's tree", "Buy chicken
nuggets from Trader Joe's" tasks.

Requirements:
-Single Page Application (SPA)


-Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern


-Object-relational mapping (ORM) technique for database management



-Dependency injection technique


-Use tokens for authentication
